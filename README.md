# resnet50
Pretrained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network
## Description
ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The network is 50 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224.
